# PDF Editor

Try out https://github.com/Stirling-Tools/Stirling-PDF or https://github.com/24eme/signaturepdf instead!

Still a work in progress, check back later or *watch* this project's releases.

Name suggestions are appreciated, after all "PDF Editor" is about as bland and generic as it gets.

Planned features

- Web-based, no installation required
- Fully client-side, your PDFs never leave your computer
- Works offline
